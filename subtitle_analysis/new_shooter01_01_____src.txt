A bullet will kill you three ways.
20
The first way: extremities.
21
Miss a major artery and you got 10 to 20 minutes
22
before you bleed out.
23
The second way: anywhere in the tens, center chest.
24
The bullet will tumble, lots of bone to splinter,
25
the heart or the arteries get hit,
26
blood pressure drops to zero.
27
The final way is the kill shot.
28
Middle of the skull, any angle.
29
Like a marionette with the strings cut,
30
you're dead before your brain can process what happened.
31
Guns change everything,
32
and a bullet is forever.
33
Easy, easy.
34
I'm not here to hurt you.
35
Yeah, there you go.
36
Just a little something in case you get an infection.
37
Be good to go in a day.
38
Hey, that wolf is ours.
39
She might have a different opinion.
40
What did you do to it?
41
Tranquilizer, so I could get that trap off.
42
What you got there?
43
What the hell are you doing?
44
Let me guess, dentist?
45
Orthodontist.
46
What does that have to do with anything?
47
.223 Remington.
48
55 grain?
49
You guys have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?
50
The kid at Walmart who sold you this crap should've told you.
51
This bullet isn't powerful enough
52
to take down anything bigger than a squirrel.
53
How 'bout this one?
54
You think it has enough stopping power for you?
55
Washington State doesn't allow trap hunting of wolves.
56
But, even if it was legal,
57
it's a bullshit way to kill an animal like that.
58
If you're gonna hunt, at least give the animal a chance.
59
Well, we ain't giving out chances today, asshole.
60
See how you like being hunted when you can't move.
70
Daddy!
71
Mama, Daddy's home!
72
He's home?
73
Yeah.
74
You save me any dinner, kitten-mouse?
75
Mom said you were supposed to be bringing dinner.
76
Mom, Dad didn't get dinner.
77
What? Do you think maybe he's pulling your leg?
78
I don't know. Maybe?
79
Yeah, let's hope so.
80
I found it.
81
Come on down and get it for your mom.
82
Go grab it.
83
I gotta put my tools away.
84
Okay, honey.
85
I got it all, right?
86
Your orange chicken, egg rolls,
87
and an extra sweet and sour sauce.
88
Yeah. I did see that.
89
I'm surprised though.
90
You know, you went hunting all day,
91
and all you shot me was Chinese takeout, huh?
92
I had something, but I missed.
93
Bullshit.
94
You don't miss, Bob Lee.
95
Missed you.
96
Bless us, oh, Lord, for these thy gifts,
97
which we're about to receive,
98
from thy bounty through Christ our Lord.
99
Amen.
100
Good job, honey. I think that was your best grace yet.
101
You say that every night.
102
He does, doesn't he?
103
'Cause you keep getting better.
104
- There you go. - Don't you get bored all alone up there?
105
Bored?
106
How could I get bored in all that beautiful nature
107
and animals and plants?
108
And there's a million things to do out there.
109
But there's no Internet.
110
Exactly.
111
That's the whole point.
112
That's why it's Daddy's happy place.
113
Up the wooden hill.
114
It is time for bed.
115
No, Daddy.
116
Yes, Mary.
117
Ready?
118
Here, get under.
119
Story first.
120
I'm-- you know what?
121
Your mommy really wants me to spend some time with her.
122
Can we do story tomorrow?
123
Please, please, please, Daddy.
124
Okay.
125
- What do you wanna hear? - Kandahar!
126
Oh, honey, Kandahar takes too long.
127
Tikrit?
128
Fine, Basrah.
129
Basrah.
130
You've heard this one, like, six times.
131
Then this will make seven.
132
All right.
133
So we're going after Basan Al Amini.
134
We got a small squad.
135
Donny and I were on recon.
136
Night vision?
137
We don't need night vision. We're Marines.
138
Semper Fi.
139
Semper Fi.
140
Why don't you just use your Kung Fu to break it?
141
It's not called Kung Fu, Mouse.
142
It's not for cutting wood.
143
Who's that, Daddy?
144
Can you go get Daddy an OJ?
145
Please?
146
Go on.
147
You've been parked up at the turnout for about an hour.
148
Trying to make me nervous?
149
I thought snipers didn't get nervous?
150
I said trying.
151
It's good to see you, Gunny.
152
You too, Captain Johnson.
153
Even though you were hard to track down.
154
Couldn't find any place more remote?
155
I don't mind people. I just like to see 'em coming.
156
You look good, Bob Lee.
157
How's the hip?
158
Don't think I'll be in Cirque Du Soleil anytime soon,
159
but getting by.
160
Is this a friendly call or Secret Service business?
161
Your lapel pin.
162
That's color of the day, right?
163
Damn, you really don't miss a thing, do you?
164
Turns out a guy who ran snipers for the Corps
165
actually has some value.
166
I'm on the President's advance team.
167
All right.
168
You got a place we could talk, privately?
169
Yeah, it's down here.
170
I see you are still a bleeding heart liberal.
171
You never know when shit's gonna get weird.
172
What can I do for you, Captain?
173
This is gonna be one of those conversations we never had.
174
Ten days ago, a CIA agent was killed
175
in Seneca State Forest, Virginia.
176
He was shot by a sniper.
177
We found the hide 1,400 yards away.
178
- Damn. - No evidence of multiple shots.
179
Damn, 1,400 yards.
180
One shot, so he couldn't afford to miss.
181
Lots of trees.
182
Three steps and the target would be behind the canopy, right?
183
That doesn't look like a .50 cal.
184
.338 based on the slug.
185
All right, so...
186
3/4-mile shot through the woods.
187
You got humidity, vegetation,
188
hell, even the rotation of the Earth could be a factor.
189
Boy's a shooter.
190
Oh, yeah, he's a shooter all right.
191
This was written to the President.
192
It states that in 21 days he'll be executed
193
at the Seattle Science and Robotic Center.
194
The letter says, and I quote,
195
"I am the angel of death. No one can stop me."
196
We believe this is from T. Solotov.
197
Solotov?
198
Are you f---ing kidding me?
199
No.
200
What the hell is a Chechen sniper doing in Virginia?
201
I don't know and right now I don't care.
202
My job is to protect the President.
203
That's why I'm here.
204
I gotta check on my daughter.
205
There's only a handful of shooters in the world
206
who would take a shot from 3/4 of a mile away,
207
much less a headshot, and make it, and you're one of 'em.
208
That's why I need your help to stop him.
209
You got plenty of smart guys around you.
210
You gotta understand.
211
We get hundreds of threats a day against the President.
212
I don't have the resources to scout a shot
213
taken 500 yards outside of our tier-three perimeter.
214
Yeah, I got a handful of guys,
215
but no one like you.
216
Daddy, we gotta finish the porch before Mommy gets home.
217
Yeah, I'll be right there, honey.
218
As you can see, I'm kind of busy.
219
What happened to you, Gunny?
220
I'm asking for your help. The President is asking.
221
Look, man...
222
nobody blames you for Donny getting shot,
223
but you gotta put that shit behind you and move on.
224
I've moved on, Captain.
225
Your country needs you, Bob Lee.
226
What did he want?
227
Ah, nothing, baby.
229
Go get him. Quietly.
230
All right, gentlemen, that's a green light.
231
Copy that.
232
Come on, Mikey, how much longer?
233
This is not as easy as it looks.
234
I need it to be.
235
Got it.
237
FBI! Everybody down!
238
What the hell are you guys doing here?
239
Dimitri?
240
Hey, Dimitri!
241
Dimitri!
242
- How you doing? - FBI!
243
Homeland, we got here first.
244
Could you point that thing somewhere else?
246
Shut up.
247
What?
248
Oh, come on, that's six months of work
249
you're loading into that van.
250
What's your name, Agent?
251
Oh, my God, you Homeland guys are unbelievable.
252
I mean, at least let me talk to him first.
253
I assume you called the Washington State Fusion Center
254
got your ops plan on the war-board?
255
So that no other federal agency would step on your toes?
256
Isaac Johnson, Secret Service.
257
Let me get the admin on call.
258
I'm having a jurisdictional issue.
259
Wait, wait, I didn't have time to get it on the war-board.
260
Regardless, he's my asset.
261
At least tell me why you took him.
262
Why do you want him?
263
He told me he had time-sensitive Intel.
264
Intel on what?
265
Voydian runs an illegal import business.
266
You know what? I got a novel idea.
267
I mean, why don't we work together, you know?
268
FBI, Secret Service, Homeland,
269
we're all on the same side, right?
270
No. Let me see your shield.
271
Agent Memphis.
272
So you cowboy into a known Russian mob establishment
273
over illegal imports?
274
Oh, you thought it was something bigger?
275
Yeah, well, guess I was right since you just snatched him up.
276
You gonna tell me why?
277
No.
278
Nice to meet you.
279
She went down like a rock.
280
Well, we worked hard today.
281
Deck looks good.
282
Hey, I was gonna tell you.
283
About?
284
About Captain Johnson coming by.
285
She just beat me to it.
286
She said he offered you a job.
287
Yeah, he said, uh, some sniper
288
made a crazy threat against the President.
289
Wanted me to help him clear it.
290
Sniper who?
291
Solotov?
292
Jesus.
293
Listen,
294
I know that you don't like to talk about this stuff,
295
but what happened to Donny,
296
I know that it still hurts you.
297
Just let me in.
298
We've been going over this plan for a week, sir.
299
We're ready to get after it.
300
Status change on the Chechen sniper?
301
He could be everywhere or nowhere.
302
Either way, we're good to go.
303
You know they brought that asshole here to nail you, right?
304
If he's keeping me from getting behind my rifle, he already has.
305
I'm not doing anybody any favors PT-ing all day.
306
You're not doing any favors if you get yourself killed either.
307
Yes, sir.
308
You and Donny ready for the green light?
309
100%, sir.
310
Consider it lit.
311
Hey, stay dangerous.
312
Yes, sir!
313
Time to hunt, Pork.
314
Damn, finally.
315
What's the plan?
316
Overwatch for Delta.
317
We got a four klick hump to our number one.
318
Four, that's all? Thought this was gonna be hard.
319
At this rate, I'ma die of old age.
320
That's the best way to die.
321
All right, get your shit in one bag and let's go.
322
All right, all right.
323
It's about damn time, gentlemen.
324
Pork gonna get some.
325
Donny had a saying.
326
"A bullet is forever."
327
And one day I'm like,
328
"What the hell is that supposed to mean?"
329
And he just smiles and says, "You'll see."
330
So we're in this shitty pile of rocks outside of Kandahar.
331
Slow down, Donny.
332
We heard Solotov was nearby,
333
but we'd been camped out for, like, a week and nothing.
334
Could have exited from either side of the compass.
335
Besides, there's been nothing on the infrared for week.
336
No man lays still for that long.
337
Yeah, you wanna bet your life on that?
338
I'm a Marine. I'm already betting my life.
339
Donny wanted to go south.
340
It was faster.
341
My gut said we go north.
342
All right, go north.
343
You're the Nailer.
344
I told you not to call me that.
345
I'd love it if somebody would call me something cool.
346
You don't like Pork? Pork's cool.
347
You've had three spotters. You called all of them Pork.
348
It's easy to remember.
349
I don't even like bacon.
350
All right, I'm going first.
351
No, no, no.
352
I'm not making that call to your mama.
353
After me, Pork.
354
I heard it before I felt it.
355
Solotov misjudged the wind, but he...
356
recalculated for a second shot.
357
Donny, no!
358
He was dead before he fell.
359
Donny!
360
Donny was right.
361
A bullet is forever.
362
He died because I trusted my gut.
363
No, he didn't.
364
He died because Solotov shot him.
365
That wasn't your fault.
366
Look...
367
I love you,
368
and I would never tell you how to live your life,
369
but maybe the best way to put this behind you...
370
is pay back the favor.
371
Punch Solotov's ticket.
372
And what if my instincts are wrong?
373
Then you adjust your dope and you fire again.
374
I love it when you talk sexy.
375
Prove it.
376
Jack Payne, Bob Lee Swagger.
377
Payne's Counter-terrorism. He's our Solotov expert
378
Your paperwork is still moving, but I don't wanna lose a day.
379
We consider this a real threat.
380
Motorcade stops there.
381
Dignitaries and special visitors at the rope line.
382
He'll shake a few hands?
383
Yeah, but we got that covered.
384
Agents around him and in the crowd.
385
Consider it 15 seconds from the Beast to the podium.
386
How are you protecting his six?
387
Triple thick bulletproof backdrop behind him.
388
It'll stop anything.
389
He presents with the Ukrainian president,
390
then they take a tour inside.
391
Since Solotov warned you, why not cancel?
392
If we cancelled every credible threat we got,
393
he'd never leave the White House.
394
They schedule him, I secure him. That's the drill.
395
Even if we could move it, we want Solotov,
396
so if he's gonna be here, let's figure out where.
397
Now, Flashlight's route won't be made public
398
till the day before, so...
399
He doesn't need to know the route.
400
He knows where it ends.
401
He's not gonna take a shot at the President's limo.
402
It might as well be a tank.
403
Solotov's not gonna take any chances.
404
If he's hunting,
405
he's gonna wait for his shot and it'll be perfect.
406
And that's exactly why I need you Bob Lee.
407
You're the only one who can neutralize him.
408
I need a complete workup.
409
Distances, location possibilities, everything.
410
We've got some nice range tech, too.
411
I can set you up.
412
Without firing his rifle,
413
most of it'll be educated guessing.
414
Shit, Bob Lee,
415
your educated guess is better than most.
416
We got these 12 hours ago.
417
Say hello to T. Solotov.
418
That's the only known photo of him,
419
taken from a drone over the Sudan.
420
Drone wasn't even supposed to be there.
421
The pilot was taking the scenic route home,
422
caught it by accident.
424
Modified Saber-Forsst.
425
- Damn. - We rebuilt it from the photo.
426
Right down to his custom optics.
428
We'll ship it to you.
429
All right, I'll get the ammo and start shooting right away.
430
I'll check in in a couple days.
431
Sooner the better.
432
So that's the great Bob the Nailer, huh?
433
He don't seem like much.
434
There was this, uh, girls' school in Afghanistan,
435
three miles south of Jupar.
436
Bob Lee and his spotter were alone doing recon
437
when they saw a platoon of Taliban bearing down on the school.
438
You know what the Taliban does to young girls in Afghanistan
439
trying to get an education.
440
Bob Lee and his spotter could have simply moved on.
441
No one would have ever known they were there.
442
Instead,
443
he took on 200 Taliban over 46 hours.
444
Moving and shooting.
445
Didn't sleep, didn't eat, just hunted.
446
51 kills, all command level.
447
And that girls' school?
448
It's still there to this day.
449
Taliban won't go near it.
450
They say it's cursed.
451
Underestimate Bob Lee Swagger at your own peril.
452
He's the real deal.
453
Nadine, can I see you a minute?
454
I had a nice chat with a friend at the Secret Service.
455
Sir, those Homeland guys are always yelling national security
456
whenever they're snaking a bust.
457
I worked Dimitri Voydian for six months.
458
Did you know he was Russian FSB?
459
Sent over this morning courtesy of Homeland.
460
Russia said he was disavowed
461
right around the time you two met.
462
He was handling security for a small sect of the Bratva
463
feeding us Intel on rival gangs.
464
Nadine, if it got out that the FBI was helping a Russian spy...
465
Homeland did us a favor.
466
Look, Voydian called me,
467
said he had information that was gonna get him killed.
468
He said he would only give it to me.
469
He was desperate.
470
Like I don't have enough trouble with this mess?
471
And now you want to open a new investigation
472
because you got egg on your face?
473
Sit down.
474
Do me a favor.
475
Do something you don't normally do.
476
Listen to me and do not get involved
477
in this Voydian mess. That's an order.
478
You're right.
479
You've given me multiple chances.
480
You deserve better. I'm sorry.
481
Stop, you're not any good at that.
482
- At what? - Kissing ass.
483
Oh, and since you're so happy to work with the Secret Service,
484
they sent this.
485
President's visit means they prioritize potential threats
486
into three groups.
487
Those are the Charlies.
488
So the least threatening.
489
Mainly, any wacko with an email account.
490
If someone seems off,
491
send it to me and I'll pass it along.
492
Oh, and they need to be cleared.
493
Oh, and Nadine?
494
I know you're trying. I appreciate it,
495
but you need to try harder.
496
Here are the shells. Good luck with the bird.
497
Good to see you, Bob Lee.
498
Got your regular order right here.
499
Not today, Henry. I'm trying out a new rifle.
500
You got any .338 Lapua Magnum?
501
Sure we do.
502
Might need some powder and some .338 bullets too.
503
We'll take care of that.
524
I know how he's gonna do it.
525
Hail Mary, full of grace,
526
the Lord is with thee.
527
Blessed art thou among women,
528
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
529
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
530
pray for us sinners,
531
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.
533
This better be good, Agent Memphis.
534
We've got 100 different threats to clear by tomorrow.
535
I did some looking around,
536
and I think I'm onto something.
537
What you got for me, Agent?
538
I know Voydian was FSB.
539
I wasn't sure if it was tied to your investigion,
540
especially with the upcoming presidential visit.
541
You could have kept this FBI, why'd you call me?
542
Figured it'd be helpful.
543
And you want to get out of the Seattle Field Office.
544
I read your file.
545
You shot a hostage at the Umbauqa Bank.
546
It was a good shooting, and I've more than paid for it.
547
All right, Agent Memphis.
548
I'll have my office reach out when I get back to D.
550
See if we can find you some room.
551
If whatever you found is worth something.
552
Thank you, sir.
554
The last time Voydian and I talked,
555
he was nervous about something. It was bigger than imports.
556
Before you guys took him away, he left information for me.
557
He hid it in one of the massage rooms.
558
They're all written by the same journalist,
559
Karlyna Ordenko.
560
Now, my Ukrainian isn't great, but...
561
something about a city called Graznyole.
562
According to her, the Russians are getting ready
563
to stage something big.
564
The President's motorcade enters the kill zone at 12:34...
565
Off 4th and then onto the turnout before coming to a stop.
566
He'll exit the Beast,
567
followed by the Ukrainian president,
568
shake a few hands, then make his way to the podium
569
where he'll speak for approximately seven minutes.
570
Might as well be seven years for a sniper.
571
Knowing exactly where the President will be standing
572
gives Solotov an advantage that's almost unbeatable.
573
It's gonna have your team doubling, tripling security,
574
covering every angle of attack,
575
which is why he's not gonna take the shot there.
576
He's gonna take the shot here,
577
the moment he gets out of his limo.
578
No, Swagger, that-- that's not possible.
579
Let him continue, Payne.
580
The human head is roughly 22 inches in circumference.
581
The gap from his limo to the rope line is 3 yards.
582
President's gait makes that 2 1/2 steps.
583
At 1,000 yards, the shooter has almost two full seconds
584
to make the shot.
585
It is the best location hands down.
586
Solotov's not gonna take that shot.
587
Because you're moving in a giant flag as an obstruction.
588
Hanging from a crane across Denny Way.
589
That was classified. How'd you find out?
590
The same way Solotov will, by doing my homework.
591
On top of this parking garage, at 1,400 yards,
592
he has no obstructions to the motorcade stop,
593
but he's gotta shoot fast.
594
He can pre-rig the mount to the exact height
595
as long as he stops in the right spot.
596
No way he's getting away. We've got air, ground.
597
He wouldn't get ten feet.
598
And Solotov has no history of mobile hits.
599
Whatever you think you know about Solotov,
600
he knows ten times about you.
601
He's a master sniper.
602
The guy has worked in the worst conditions
603
mankind has ever created, under all kinds of heavy fire
604
with one goal: to kill his target.
605
He knows the window around the event,
606
he knows the Secret Service schedule,
607
he knows the perimeters,
608
and he knows the exact moment to take the shot,
609
and he's gonna take it from here.
610
1,580 yards,
611
line of sight to the President for a full three seconds,
612
wide enough so the wind won't be a surprise.
613
Got Solotov here shooting low,
614
sunlight behind him so the target's well lit.
615
He'll be out the door before you hear the shot.
616
But he won't shoot through glass.
617
It'll screw with trajectory.
618
Small wired charges...
619
will break the window timed to the shot.
620
No one'll hear the glass until it's too late.
621
That's how it's gonna go down.
622
The President appreciates you jumping in.
623
If you're available, I know he'd like to thank you peonally.
624
That won't be necessary, Captain.
625
- I'm happy to help. - Trust me.
626
He won't take "No" For an answer.
627
Payne, get your team ready.
628
You guys can prep here.
629
- I'm gonna get the man who shot you, Bob Lee. - Yes, sir.
630
Something wrong?
631
No, I must have left the light on.
632
- Here. - Okay. Yep.
633
I'm gonna go turn it off.
634
Hey, did you get my Charlie list?
635
Three names. Passed 'em on last night.
636
Something wrong?
637
Yeah, there was one guy on the list,
638
ex-Marine, seemed off.
639
I didn't see any Marine.
640
It's just that he was--
641
it was odd that he was being considered a Charlie.
642
His record was completely clean, sparkling.
643
Yeah.
644
Anyway, you going to this thing?
645
No, I've met the President.
646
Um, they say they need bodies on the outer perimeter.
647
- You wanna help out? - I have a bunch of stuff--
648
I'll forward this to you, okay?
649
You can close the door on the way out.
650
Flashlight is three minutes out.
651
Try to relax a little.
652
It's exciting just to be here.
653
Let's move back a little.
654
If we do that, we're gonna be sitting
655
on our front porch watching.
656
I think we can see better from over there. Come on.
657
Flashlight is one minute out.
658
Is everything okay?
659
Something's wrong.
660
They shoulda had him by now.
661
- Hello? - JACK: It's Payne.
662
- He's not here. - What?
663
He's not here.
664
No Solotov, no gun, no nothing.
665
Oh, no.
666
- Get out of here, now. - What?
667
- Go, just go! - No, Bob Lee, where are you going?
668
I made a mistake.
669
He's gonna use charges to drop the flag.
670
He's in location "A." You gotta call Johnson.
671
- You're breaking up. - Call him!
672
...just arriving.
673
We can see his car. We can only assume that...
674
There has just been a shooting.
675
We don't know where the shot came from.
676
We can't see who's been hit,
677
but the Secret Service are surrounding the convoy.
679
We are trying to get a clear picture of what's goinon,
680
but the scene is absolute chaos.
681
Hey, Swagger.
682
What did he want?
684
Stay on the ground, now!
685
Hands behind your head!
686
- Do it! - My name is Bob Lee Swagger!
687
I did not kill the President!
